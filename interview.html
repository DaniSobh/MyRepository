   <h2> 1. Research the company</h2>
Before going into the interview, research the company along with its history, values and mission. Check their official website first,
 then move onto other sources. If there are any client, customer or employee reviews, study them and identify any recurring themes that
  might alter your decision to work with them. It also prepares you to answer any questions relating to the company, proving to your 
  interview that you familiarized yourself with who the company is.</div>
  <br>
  <br>
 
<h2>2. Research your interviewer</h2>
Along with researching the company, identify who within the organization might interview you and research them as well. Identify their
 professional social media profiles and scan through their interests. It often helps to find common ground with your interviewer and bring
  it up during the interview. For example, if you mention that you both enjoy hiking, you immediately stand out to the interviewer, ensuring
   they take additional consideration toward you after you leave.

<h2>3. Prepare a set of questions</h2>
At the end of the interview, most interviewers open up to questions from the interviewee. Having questions prepared at the end often shows
 that you have a greater interest in the role and want to learn more about the company. Consider questions such as:

What is the company culture like?
Is there an opportunity for growth in this role?
How do you measure employee performance?
What is the most challenging aspect of the position?
What do you enjoy most about working with this company?</div>

<h2>4. Conduct a mock interview</h2>
Find someone you trust or who has experience in interviewing and conduct a mock interview. Assign them a series of questions to ask related
 to your role. Encourage them to find or come up with additional questions as well without telling you what they are. At the end of the 
 interview, take any feedback they have on improving your performance. Once ready, conduct the mock interview again.

 <h2>5. Print out physical copies of your resume</h2>
Even though they have your resume on file, many interviewers prefer seeing a physical copy during the interview. Print several copies out
 before your interview in preparation for them to ask. Additionally, if they ask any questions directly related to your resume, you can 
 immediately reference it to address their questions or concerns.</div>

 <h2>6. Eat a healthy meal before the interview</h2>
Consider eating a healthy meal several hours before your interview. Consider foods rich in protein, healthy fats and fiber
 such as:<br>

Whole grain toast<br>
Avocado<br>
Spinach<br>
Whole eggs<br>

<h2>7. Clean and press your clothes</h2>
At least a day before your interview, ensure you have a clean set of clothes. Iron and press formal clothes such as dress pants and dress 
shirts to free them of wrinkles. Additionally, pack make-up and deodorant for small touch-ups just before your interview, if necessary.</div>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>8. Dress for the role</h2>
  Choose a set of clothes that are appropriate for the role. For best results, choose clothes that are a step above the role's normal standards.
  For example, if the role requires business casual attire, choose business professional attire for the interview, including a suit and tie or
  skirt and blouse.

    <h2>9. Turn your cell phone off before the interview</h2>
    Bringing your phone into the interview with you is often a necessity. If you need it, consider silencing
   it or turning it off. Ensure no vibrations or other tones emanate from your phone or interrupt
   the interview.

   <h2>10. Prepare for different types of interviews</h2>
    There are three primary types of interviews. A behavioral interview focuses on how you react in employment-based situations.
    Most of the questions present specific scenarios and allow you to address how you might handle them. Experiential interviews 
    focus on your previous experience and the decisions you made in the past. The third type of interview is a combination of both
    behavioral and experiential interviews.<br>

    <div style="position: relative; right: -60%;">

    <h2>11. Consider stories from previous positions</h2>
    Interviewers often ask questions that encourage you to describe situations that occurred in previous positions. This gives them
    a better understanding of how you might react to similar situations that occur within their workplace. Before your interview, think
    back to your previous positions to memorable situations that you excelled in. Use them as examples to answer certain questions.
