            <h2>1. Research the company</h2>
            <p>Before going into the interview, research the company along with its history, values and mission. Check their official website first,
                then move onto other sources. If there are any client, customer or employee reviews, study them and identify any recurring themes that
                might alter your decision to work with them. It also prepares you to answer any questions relating to the company, proving to your
                interview that you familiarized yourself with who the company is.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>2. Research your interviewer</h2>
        <p>Along with researching the company, identify who within the organization might interview you and research them as well. Identify their
            professional social media profiles and scan through their interests. It often helps to find common ground with your interviewer and bring
            it up during the interview. For example, if you mention that you both enjoy hiking, you immediately stand out to the interviewer, ensuring
            they take additional consideration toward you after you leave.</p>
        <img src="int1.png" class="interview_images" id="int2">

        <br>
        <div style="position: relative; right: -60%;">
            <h2>3. Prepare a set of questions</h2>
            <p>At the end of the interview, most interviewers open up to questions from the interviewee. Having questions prepared at the end often shows
                that you have a greater interest in the role and want to learn more about the company. Consider questions such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the company culture like?</li>
                <li>Is there an opportunity for growth in this role?</li>
                <li>How do you measure employee performance?</li>
                <li>What is the most challenging aspect of the position?</li>
                <li>What do you enjoy most about working with this company?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <img src="int3.png" class="interview_images" id="int3">
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>4. Conduct a mock interview</h2>
        <p>Find someone you trust or who has experience in interviewing and conduct a mock interview. Assign them a series of questions to ask related
            to your role. Encourage them to find or come up with additional questions as well without telling you what they are. At the end of the
            interview, take any feedback they have on improving your performance. Once ready, conduct the mock interview again.</p>
        <br>

        <div style="position: relative; right: -60%;">
            <h2>5. Print out physical copies of your resume</h2>
            <p>Even though they have your resume on file, many interviewers prefer seeing a physical copy during the interview. Print several copies out
                before your interview in preparation for them to ask. Additionally, if they ask any questions directly related to your resume, you can
                immediately reference it to address their questions or concerns.</p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>6. Eat a healthy meal before the interview</h2>
        <p>Consider eating a healthy meal several hours before your interview. Consider foods rich in protein, healthy fats and fiber such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole grain toast</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Spinach</li>
            <li>Whole eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <div style="position: relative; right: -60%;">
            <h2>7. Clean and press your clothes</h2>
            <p>At least a day before your interview, ensure you have a clean set of clothes. Iron and press formal clothes such as dress pants and dress
                shirts to free them of wrinkles. Additionally, pack make-up and deodorant for small touch-ups just before your interview, if necessary.</p>
        </div>

        <img src="int7.png" id="int7">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>8. Dress for the role</h2>
        <p>Choose a set of clothes that are appropriate for the role. For best results, choose clothes that are a step above the role's normal standards.
            For example, if the role requires business casual attire, choose business professional attire for the interview, including a suit and tie or
            skirt and blouse.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div style="position: relative; right: -60%;">
            <h2>9. Turn your cell phone off before the interview</h2>
            <p>Bringing your phone into the interview with you is often a necessity. If you need it, consider silencing
                it or turning it off. Ensure no vibrations or other tones emanate from your phone or interrupt
                the interview.</p>
        </div>

        <img src="int8.webp" id="int8">
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>10. Prepare for different types of interviews</h2>
        <p>There are three primary types of interviews. A behavioral interview focuses on how you react in employment-based situations.
            Most of the questions present specific scenarios and allow you to address how you might handle them. Experiential interviews
            focus on your previous experience and the decisions you made in the past. The third type of interview is a combination of both
            behavioral and experiential interviews.</p>
        <img src="int9.webp" class="interview_images" id="int9">
        <br>
        <br>
        <div style="position: relative; right: -60%;">
            <h2>11. Consider stories from previous positions</h2>
            <p>Interviewers often ask questions that encourage you to describe situations that occurred in previous positions. This gives them
                a better understanding of how you might react to similar situations that occur within their workplace. Before your interview, think
                back to your previous positions to memorable situations that you excelled in. Use them as examples to answer certain questions.</p>

        <h3>Listen Actively</h3>
        <p>Pay close attention to the interviewer's question. Make sure you understand it fully before answering. If you're unsure about
            something, don't hesitate to ask for clarification.</p>

        <h3>Take a Moment to Think</h3>
        <p>It's okay to take a brief pause to gather your thoughts before answering. This shows that you're
            thoughtful and not just giving a rushed response.</p>

        <h3>Answer Concisely</h3>
        <p>Be clear and concise in your responses. Avoid rambling or going off on tangents. Focus on directly addressing
            the question asked.</p>

        <h3>Use the STAR Method</h3>
        <p>When answering behavioral questions, use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure
            your responses. This helps you provide a well-organized and comprehensive answer.</p>

        <h3>Highlight Relevant Skills and Experience</h3>
        <p>Tailor your responses to showcase how your skills and past experiences make you a
            strong fit for the position. Provide specific examples whenever possible.</p>

        <h3>Stay Positive and Professional</h3>
        <p>Maintain a positive attitude throughout the interview. Avoid speaking negatively about
            previous employers or colleagues. Be polite and professional in your tone and demeanor.</p>

        <h3>Ask for Clarification</h3>
        <p>If a question is unclear or if you need more information to answer it effectively, don't hesitate to
            ask for clarification or request more context.</p>

        <h3>Engage with the Interviewer</h3>
        <p>Interviews are not just about answering questions but also building rapport. Engage with the
            interviewer by making eye contact, nodding, and showing enthusiasm for the role.</p>

        <h3>Avoid Over-Sharing</h3>
        <p>While it's important to provide relevant information, avoid over-sharing personal details or going
            off-topic. Stick to professional topics.</p>

        <h3>Follow the Interviewer's Lead</h3>
        <p>If the interviewer is more conversational, you can engage in a discussion. If they prefer
            structured questions, provide structured answers.</p>

        <h3>Close Strong</h3>
        <p>At the end of the interview, express your interest in the position and ask about the next steps in the hiring
            process. Thank the interviewer for their time and consideration.</p>

        <h3>Stay Calm and Confident</h3>
        <p>It's natural to feel nervous, but try to stay calm and confident throughout the interview. Remember
            that it's also an opportunity for you to evaluate if the company is a good fit for you.</p>

        <h3>Body Language Matters</h3>
        <p>Maintain good posture, use appropriate gestures, and make eye contact to convey confidence and
            professionalism.</p>

        <h3>Be Honest</h3>
        <p>Always be truthful in your responses. If you don't know the answer to a technical question, admit it, but express
            your willingness to learn.</p>

            their time and reiterate your interest in the position. This is also an opportunity to briefly mention key points from the interview

        <h3>2. Review and Reflect:</h3>
        <p>Take some time to reflect on the interview. Think about your responses and the questions asked. Identify any areas where you could have
            performed better or provided more detailed answers. This reflection can help you improve for future interviews.</p><br>

        <h3>3. Follow Up on Promised Actions:</h3>
        <p>If you discussed any specific actions during the interview, such as providing additional documents or references, make sure to follow
            through on these commitments promptly.</p>

        <h3>4. Continue Your Job Search:</h3>
        <p>While waiting for a response from the prospective employer, continue your job search. Don't put all
            your eggs in one basket. Keep applying to other positions and attending interviews if you have them scheduled.</p> <br>

        <h3>5. Stay Patient:</h3>
        <p>It can be nerve-wracking to wait for a response after an interview, but it's essential to be patient. The hiring process can take
            time, and the decision-making may involve multiple rounds of interviews or discussions.</p>

        <h3>6. Network:</h3>
        <p>Use this time to expand your professional network. Connect with interviewers and other employees from the company on LinkedIn or other
            professional networking platforms. Engaging with them can help keep you on their radar</p><br>

        <h3>7. Send a Follow-Up Email (if Necessary):</h3>
        <p>If a reasonable amount of time has passed without an update and you haven't heard back from the employer, it's acceptable to send
            a polite follow-up email to inquire about the status of your application. Be respectful and express your continued interest.</p><br>

        <h3>8. Prepare for a Second Interview:</h3>
        <p>If you are invited for a second interview, take the time to prepare thoroughly. Review your previous interview performance, research
            the company and role further, and be ready for more in-depth questions.</p><br>

        <h3>9. Maintain a Positive Attitude:</h3>
        <p>Regardless of the outcome, maintain a positive attitude. Job hunting can be challenging, but a positive mindset is essential for
            success. If you receive a rejection, use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p><br>

        <h3>10. Seek Feedback:</h3>
        <p>If you receive feedback from the employer, whether it's a rejection or an offer, take it constructively. Use any feedback to improve
            your interview skills and tailor your approach for future opportunities.</p><br>
